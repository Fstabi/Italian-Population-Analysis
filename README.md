## Is the Italian population really in danger of extinction?

This is a data analysis project where I analyzed the evolution of the Italian demographic situation over the last 30 years. 
The idea for this analysis came to me following the words of Elon Musk about the Italian population.

The repository probably won't have any changes / updates in the future since the project is concluded, but the R codes and datasets could be useful (to me or to any user), so I decided to upload it.

The repository is divided into three parts:

- A pdf file with the narration / comment of the analysis and the charts obtained by executing the R codes
- The R codes to get the charts
- The complete database I used for the analysis in csv format

### Code:
The code is very easy to use, you just need to import the csv files into a file in RStudio (I used that) and run it.

I attach an example of how the code, the dataset and the table you get from the code look like, they are all related to the same chart (growth rate).

The data for this analysis were found in the websites [World Open Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) and [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), the sources are also reported in the charts.
